# services/api — `tilo-api`

## Purpose
Cloud Run service (PRD 6.2): sessions, tasks, cards, approvals, policies, downloads, sharing,
RBAC. The only service the web client and channels write through; the client reads live state
from Firestore directly under security rules.

## Commands
- `uv sync --package tilo-api` — install
- `uv run --package tilo-api uvicorn tilo_api:app --reload --port 8080` — dev server
- `uv run --package tilo-api pytest` — tests
- `just dev` / `just check` — from the repo root

## Contracts
- Reads/writes: `packages/contracts-py` types; Firestore (worlds, events, cards, policies,
  grants); Cloud Tasks to start harness runs.

## Config
- `config/autonomy.yaml`, `config/flags/`, `config/connectors.yaml` (RBAC and routing only).

## Requirement IDs
- Section 6.2 `tilo-api` row; SEC-05 through SEC-12 (auth, RBAC, redaction) as they land.

## Local rules
- Every side effect goes through the outbox and the deterministic policy engine (never here
  directly); T3 actions always require a person to approve.
- `GET /healthz` returns `{"status": "ok"}` — the only route this ticket adds.
